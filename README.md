# Mongoshells Dockerfiles
This repository aims to store lites and simple mongoshell images. That means these images will not run mongod service, but only allows to connect to any mongo database. 

While browsing the web looking for a such a system, I could find noone so built my own. It is fairly basic and aims for minimalist and very small images. One of the goal being to execute mongo batches on Cloud Provided Mongo services where every little bit of data is billed to the end-user.

Feel free to comment, correct, whatever you feel necessary.
If by doing this I am actually stealing someone property, or breaking any law, please just let me know and I will remove the code as soon as possible.

Regards
